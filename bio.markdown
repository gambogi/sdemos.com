I am a 22 year old Computer Science student currently attending [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).
I work at [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) on [CoreUpdate](https://coreos.com/products/coreupdate).
I'm interested in functional programming, language design, and formal verification.
