I am a software engineer at [Red Hat][1] ([formerly][2] at [CoreOS][3]). I work
on tools for [Container Linux][4], primarily surrounding its automated update
model, such as [CoreUpdate][5] and the [Container Linux Update Operator][6], but
also working on the cloud provider metadata fetcher [coreos-metadata][7], the
ssh authorized keys file manager [update-ssh-keys][8], and components that
[Tectonic][9] uses to manage Container Linux instances.

I like writing [Haskell][10] and [Rust][11], and I'm generally into functional
programming and things with strong, static type systems.

I'm also a real person too, who likes hiking, camping, indoor bouldering, and
drinking rum, among other things.
