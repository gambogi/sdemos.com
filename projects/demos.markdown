summary: >
  A kernel (and maybe, eventually, a userspace) written in Rust as an
  exploration of both writing a kernel and Rust when it is close to the metal.
  It generally tries to adhere to the principles of microkernel architecture,
  and whenever possible takes advantage of Rust's expressive type system to
  provide behavioral guarantees and prevent me from doing Bad Things.

Yay, Rust kernel!
