[Bari](https://github.com/TravisWhitaker/bari) is an library of OpenGL-centric
math functions written for C. Much like GLM for C++, Bari aims to provide a
complete set of functions for manipulating vectors and matrices in various ways
that are applicable to graphics programming. The interface for Bari is designed
with ease of use and OpenGL interoperability in mind.
